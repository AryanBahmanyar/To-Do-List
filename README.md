# to-do-list
This webpage allows users to create a list of tasks to do which can then be checked off. The tasks automatically get saved in the browser's local storage so that when users close the page and come back, their tasks will still be there. The purpose of this project was to learn to save data to and retrieve it from the local storage. This project was done as part of the "Frontend Developer" course on Hyperskill.
